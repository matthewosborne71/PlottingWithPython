# PlottingWithPython

This repository will contain files for a special lecture on some more advanced
plotting techniques using python. This is in conjunction with the Erd&#337;s Institute's
2019 coding bootcamp.

In this lecture we will go through plotting with python. We will start with
matplotlib, go through some features of seaborn, and end with one or two interactive
plots. We will use both generated and real data sets.
